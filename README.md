# DragonHacks_Hospital

A simple predictor of hospital quality. Due to dependencies issues, I could not complete and deploy the app before the hacking deadline, but this will be a work-in-progress throughout my summer.

Through this project, I want to gain more practice in data wrangling, machine learning, server-side Python, and working with APIs.
