# DragonHacks - Hospital App

A simple predictor of hospital quality. Due to dependencies issues, I could not complete and deploy the app before the hacking deadline. Through this project, I wanted to gain more practice in data wrangling, machine learning, server-side Python, and working with APIs. I did gain good experience which helped in my future project and in my job later on.

I considered this project as "On-going", because I plan to continue gain better understanding of Machine Learning, at least to understand why my model was not working and to gain a proper comprehension of the subject.
